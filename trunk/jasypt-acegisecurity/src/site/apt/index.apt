  <<Jasypt 1.8 RELEASED!>> (July 25th, 2011). [{{{download.html}DOWNLOAD}}] [{{{changelog.html}ChangeLog}}]
    

Java Simplified Encryption

  Jasypt is a java library which allows 
  the developer to add basic encryption capabilities to his/her 
  projects with minimum effort, and without the need of having 
  deep knowledge on how cryptography works.

    * High-security, standards-based encryption techniques, both for unidirectional
    and bidirectional encryption. Encrypt passwords, texts, numbers, binaries...
    
    * Transparent integration with <<Hibernate>>.
    
    * Suitable for integration into <<Spring>>-based applications and also
      transparently integrable with <<Spring Security>>.
      
    * Integrated capabilities for encrypting the configuration of applications
      (i.e. datasources).
      
    * Specific features for <<high-performance encryption>> in multi-processor/multi-core systems.

    * Open API for use with any JCE provider.

    * {{{features.html}...and much more}}

  Have a look at the complete set of <<{{{features.html}Jasypt Features}}>>
  or check the <<{{{faq.html}FAQ}}>>.

  With Jasypt, encrypting and checking a password can be as simple as...
  
----------------
BasicPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new BasicPasswordEncryptor();
String encryptedPassword = passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(userPassword);
...
if (passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(inputPassword, encryptedPassword)) {
  // correct!
} else {
  // bad login!
}
----------------
  
  ...encrypting and decrypting a text...
  
----------------
BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
textEncryptor.setPassword(myEncryptionPassword);
String myEncryptedText = textEncryptor.encrypt(myText);
...
String plainText = textEncryptor.decrypt(myEncryptedText);
----------------

  ...and what about encrypting some sensitive data directly from Hibernate?

----------------
<class name="Employee" table="EMPLOYEE">
  ...
  <property name="address" column="ADDRESS" type="encryptedString" />
  <property name="salary" column="SALARY" type="encryptedDecimal" />
  ...
<class>
----------------
  
  But of course, besides easy, <<jasypt is highly configurable>>. You will
  be able to choose encryption algorithms, salt generation and many more
  advanced features...
