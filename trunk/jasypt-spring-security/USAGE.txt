 
 Using JASYPT-SPRING-SECURITY from Maven 2
 -----------------------------------------
 
 To use it in your Maven 2 applications, you will need to add it as
 a dependency with:

     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.jasypt</groupId>
       <artifactId>jasypt-spring-security</artifactId>
       <version>{version}</version>
       <scope>compile</scope>
     </dependency>

 In order for this to work correctly, you need to have previously installed
 jasypt-spring-security in your local repository (as explained in BUILD.txt)
 or have a working internet connection to let maven automatically download 
 jasypt-spring-security binaries from Maven 2's central repositories.
 
 
 IMPORTANT: Adding jasypt-spring-security as a dependency to your maven 2 
 project will automatically add a dependency on jasypt, even if you do not
 specify so.
