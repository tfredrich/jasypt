Encrypting numbers

  Jasypt offers support for performing PBE (Password Based Encryption)
  operations on numbers. This is offered through the
  <<<org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.PBEBigIntegerEncryptor>>> and
  <<<org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.PBEBigDecimalEncryptor>>>
  interfaces and their respective default implementations, 
  <<org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEBigIntegerEncryptor>> and
  <<org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor>>.

* Basics

  Jasypt uses the byte (binary) encryption mechanisms as a basis for
  text encryption.
        
  Note that encrypted numbers will need much more digits for its
  representation than the original numbers from which they come, and so
  they will also need more space for being stored. For example, a 4-byte
  integer will probably have a size of no less than 16 bytes, once encrypted.
  <This is why only BigIntegers and BigDecimals can be encrypted with jasypt,
  and not usual integers, longs, floats... (although these can be encrypted
  in hibernate as Strings instead of numbers)> .
  
  
* Usage
  
  Assuming that you will be using the default implementations, once a
  <<<StandardPBEBigIntegerEncryptor>>> or  <<<StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor>>>
  instance has been created, this is how it will work:

** Configuration

 The algorithm, password and key-obtention iterations can take 
 values in any of these ways:
 
     * Using its default values (except for password).
     
     * Setting an <<<org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.PBEConfig>>> 
       object which provides new configuration values. {{{advancedconfiguration.html}Learn More}}.
       
     * Calling the corresponding <<<setAlgorithm(...)>>>, 
       <<<setProvider(...)>>>, <<<setProviderName(...)>>>,
       <<<setPassword(...)>>>, <<<setKeyObtentionIterations(...)>>> 
       or <<<setSaltGenerator(...)>>> methods.

 And the actual values to be used for initialization will be established
 by applying the following priorities:

     * First, the default values are considered (except for password).
      
     * Then, if a <<<link org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.PBEConfig>>>
       object has been set with <<<setConfig(...)>>>, the non-null values 
       returned by its <<<getX()>>> methods override the default values.
       
     * Finally, if the corresponding <<<setX(...)>>> method has been called
       on the encryptor itself for any of the configuration parameters, the 
       values set by these calls override all of the above.

       
** Initialization

  Before it is ready to encrypt, an object of this class has to be
  <initialised>. Initialisation happens:

     * When <<<initialize()>>> is called.
     
     * When <<<encrypt(...)>>> or <<<decrypt(...)>>> are called for the
       first time, if <<<initialize()>>> has not been called before

     * Once an encryptor has been initialised, trying to
       change its configuration willresult in an 
       <<<AlreadyInitializedException>>> being thrown.


** Usage

  An encryptor may be used for:

     * <Encrypting messages>, by calling the <<<encrypt(..)>>> method.
     
     * <Decrypting messages>, by calling the <<<decrypt(...)>>> method.

 <<When using a random salt generator, two encryption results for 
 the same message will always be different (except in the case of random 
 salt coincidence)>>. This enforces security by difficulting brute force
 attacks on sets of data at a time and forcing attackers to perform a brute 
 force attack on each separate piece of encrypted data.

* Code examples

  Easiest use: the <<<BasicIntegerNumberEncryptor>>> and <<<BasicDecimalNumberEncryptor>>> util classes:
  
----------------
...
BigInteger myNumber = ...;
...
BasicIntegerNumberEncryptor numberEncryptor = new BasicIntegerNumberEncryptor();
numberEncryptor.setPassword(myEncryptionPassword);
...
BigInteger myEncryptedNumber = numberEncryptor.encrypt(myNumber);
...
BigInteger plainNumber = numberEncryptor.decrypt(myEncryptedNumber);
...
----------------

  More security: the <<<StrongIntegerNumberEncryptor>>> and <<<StrongDecimalNumberEncryptor>>> util classes 
  with a much more secure (but slower!)
  algorithm (you may need to download and install the {{{http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads}Java Cryptography 
  Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files}} to use them):

----------------
...
BigDecimal myNumber = ...;
...
StrongDecimalNumberEncryptor numberEncryptor = new StrongDecimalNumberEncryptor();
numberEncryptor.setPassword(myEncryptionPassword);
...
BigDecimal myEncryptedNumber = numberEncryptor.encrypt(myNumber);
...
BigDecimal plainNumber = numberEncryptor.decrypt(myEncryptedNumber);
...
----------------
  
  All these <util> classes are in fact pre-configured, easy-to-use versions of their
  corresponding full-featured classes <<<StandardPBEBigIntegerEncryptor>>> and, <<<StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor>>>
  so let's use the original classes for total control:
  
------------------
...
BigDecimal myNumber = ...;
...
StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor encryptor = new StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor();
encryptor.setPassword("jasypt");                     // we HAVE TO set a password
encryptor.setAlgorithm("PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES");    // optionally set the algorithm
...
BigDecimal myEncryptedNumber = encryptor.encrypt(myNumber);
...
BigDecimal plainNumber = encryptor.decrypt(myEncryptedNumber);
...
------------------

  And we can even use a pooled version for higher performance in multi-processor/multi-core systems:
  
---
...
BigInteger myNumber = ...;
...
PooledPBEBigIntegerEncryptor encryptor = new PooledPBEBigIntegerEncryptor();
encryptor.setPoolSize(4);          // This would be a good value for a 4-core system
encryptor.setPassword("jasypt");
encryptor.setAlgorithm("PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES");
...
BigInteger myEncryptedNumber = encryptor.encrypt(myNumber);
...
BigInteger plainNumber = encryptor.decrypt(myEncryptedNumber);
...
---
