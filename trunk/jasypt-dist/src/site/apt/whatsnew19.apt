What is new in Jasypt 1.9?

* Hibernate 4 compatibility

  Although at the time of publishing jasypt 1.9.0 Hibernate 4 is still in Candidate Release
  stage, 
  encryption types produce exceptions during initialization.
  
  This issue has been fixed while keeping backwards compatibility with older 3.x versions
  of Hibernate.


* Enhanced Spring 3.0 compatibility

* Spring 3.1 compatibility

* Apache Wicket 1.5 compatibility
