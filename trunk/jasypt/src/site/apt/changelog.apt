Changes from 1.1 to 1.2

     * <<Merged jasypt-hibernate and jasypt-spring-security into main jasypt trunk>>.
         
     * Numeric encryption functionalities: 
     
       * New <<<StandardPBEBigIntegerEncryptor>>> and 
       <<<StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor>>> in the 
       <<<org.jasypt.encryption.pbe>>> package.
         
     * Salt generation functionalities: 
         
       * Created new salt generation infrastructure, making different 
         implementations of salt generation possible (including fixed salt).
         Jasypt now provides three implementations: secure random salt, fixed
         byte[]-based salt and fixed String-based salt.
     
     * Utils:
     
       * Refactored util package (<<<org.jasypt.util>>>) into 
         several subpackages: <<<binary>>>, <<<digest>>>, <<<numeric>>>,
         <<<password>>> and <<<text>>>.
         
       * Created <<<PasswordEncryptor>>> and <<<TextEncryptor>>> interfaces,
         to unify both basic- and strong-encryption implementations.
         <NOTE: the old org.jasypt.util classes have been DEPRECATED, and will be
         removed in jasypt 1.3.>
         
       * Added <<<org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor>>> for a more
         configurable way of using the "easy" password encryptor.
        
       * Added binary utils (<<<org.jasypt.util.binary>>>) for easy encryption of 
         binaries.
       
       * Added new <<<org.jasypt.util.numeric>>> package with easy utils for numeric 
         encryption.
     
     * Hibernate integration:

       * Refactored <<<org.jasypt.hibernate>>> package into new <<<encryptor>>> and 
         <<<type>>> subpackages.
         <NOTE: the old org.jasypt.hibernate classes have been DEPRECATED, and will be
         removed in jasypt 1.3.>
         
       * Added <<<HibernatePBEEncryptorRegistry>>> support for <<<BigInteger>>>, 
         <<<BigDecimal>>> and <<<Byte>>> encryptors.
       
       * Added creation of standard encryptor in Hibernate encryptor objects
         so that <<<setEncryptor()>>> method becomes optional and hibernate encryptors
         can be directly configured via <<<setPassword()>>>, <<<setAlgorithm()>>>, etc.
         
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of binaries (byte[]) into SQL BLOBs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of BigIntegers into SQL NUMERICs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of BigDecimals into SQL NUMERICs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of Bytes into SQL VARCHARs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of Shorts into SQL VARCHARs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of Integers into SQL VARCHARs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of Longs into SQL VARCHARs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of Floats into SQL VARCHARs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of Doubles into SQL VARCHARs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of Booleans into SQL VARCHARs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of Dates into SQL VARCHARs.
       
       * Added Hibernate type for encryption of Calendars into SQL VARCHARs.
     
     * Spring Security (ACEGI) integration:
         
       * Refactored <<<org.jasypt.springsecurity>>> package: created new 
         <<<PasswordEncoder>>> class for use with both 
         <<<org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor>>>
         or <<<org.jasypt.digest.StringDigester>>> implementations.
         <NOTE: the old org.jasypt.springsecurity classes have been DEPRECATED, and will be
         removed in jasypt 1.3.>
       
       * Created new <<<org.jasypt.springsecurity.PBEPasswordEncoder>>> for using
         <<<org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor>>> or 
         <<<org.jasypt.pbe.encryptor.PBEStringEncryptor>>> from ACEGI Security
         (bi-directional encryption of passwords).



Changes from 1.0 to 1.1

     * [jasypt-spring-security] Added the {{{http://www.acegisecurity.org}Spring Security (Acegi Security)}} integration module.
     
     * [jasypt] Added <<<org.jasypt.util.StrongPasswordEncryptor>>> as a <util> class for
     easy password encryption using a stronger algorithm.
     
     * [jasypt] Added <<<org.jasypt.util.MessageDigester>>> as a <util> class for
     creating simple binary message digests.
     
     * [jasypt] Added <<<org.jasypt.digest.config.EnvironmentDigesterConfig>>> and
     <<<org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.EnvironmentPBEConfig>>> for configuration
     of encryptors and digesters using environment variables and system properties.
     
     * [jasypt] Objects of class <<<org.jasypt.util.PasswordEncryptor>>> now initialize their
     internal <<<StandardStringDigester>>> at instance creation.
     
     * [jasypt] Made <<<org.jasypt.digest.config.DigesterConfig>>> and 
     <<<org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.PBEConfig>>> extend <<<java.io.Serializable>>>
