Features
 
     * Jasypt follows the <<RSA standards>> for password-based cryptography, and 
     provides you with both unidirectional and bidirectional encryption
     techniques. 
     
     []
     
     * <<Higher security for your users' passwords>>.
     {{{encrypting-passwords.html}Learn more}}.
       
     []
     
     * <<Binary encryption support>>. Jasypt allows the
     digest and encryption of binaries (byte arrays). Encrypt your objects
     or files when needed (for being sent over the net, for example).
       
     []
     
     * <<Number encryption support>>. Besides texts and binaries, it allows the
     digest and encryption of numeric values (BigInteger and BigDecimal,
     other numeric types are supported when encrypting for Hibernate 
     persistence). {{{encrypting-numbers.html}Learn more}}.
     
     []
     
     * Completely <<thread-safe>>.
     
     []

     * Provides both <<easy, no-configuration encryption tools>> for users new to 
     encryption, and also <<highly configurable standard encryption tools>>, 
     for power-users.

     []
       
     * {{{http://www.hibernate.org}Hibernate 3}} integration add-on (jasypt-hibernate)
     for persisting fields of your mapped entities in an encrypted manner.
     <<Encryption of fields is defined in the Hibernate mapping files>>, and
     it remains transparent for the rest of the application (useful for
     sensitive personal data, databases with many read-enabled users...).

     []
     
     * Seamlessly integrable into a {{{http://www.springframework.org}Spring}} application. All the 
       digesters and encryptors in jasypt are designed to be easily used 
       (instantiated, dependency-injected...) from Spring. And, because of their
       being thread-safe, they <<can be used without 
       synchronization worries in a singleton-oriented environment like 
       Spring>>. {{{spring.html}Learn more}}.

     []
     
     * {{{http://www.acegisecurity.org}Spring Security (Acegi Security)}} add-on (jasypt-spring-security)
     for performing password encryption and matching tasks for the security
     framework, improving the security of your users' passwords by using
     <<safer password encryption mechanisms>> and providing you with a
     higher degree of <<configuration and control>>. {{{springsecurity.html}Learn more}}.

     []
     
     * <<Comprehensive guides and javadoc documentation>>, to allow
     developers to better understand what they are really doing to their data.
          
     []
     
     * Robust charset support, designed to adequately encrypt and digest
     texts whichever the original charset is. <<Complete support for
     languages like Japanese, Korean, Arabic...>> with no encoding or 
     platform issues.
       
     []
     
     * Very high level of configuration capabilities: The developer can 
     implement tricks like instructing an "encryptor" to ask a, for example,
     remote HTTPS server for the password to be used for encryption. <<It lets
     you meet your security needs>>. {{{advancedconfiguration.html}Learn more}}.
