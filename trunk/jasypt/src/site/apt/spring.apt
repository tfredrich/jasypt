Integrating Jasypt with Spring Framework

  You have nothing special to do to integrate Jasypt with Spring, as all of the
  encryption tools (digesters and encryptors) in jasypt have the adequate design
  to be correctly instantiated and dependency-injected from a Spring
  application context.

  Example:

------------
  <bean id="strongEncryptor"
    class="org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEStringEncryptor">
    <property name="algorithm">
        <value>PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES</value>
    </property>
    <property name="password">
        <value>jasypt</value>
    </property>
  </bean>
------------
  
  Besides, all digesters and encryptors in jasypt are <<thread-safe>>, which
  means that they can be safely treated as singletons, the default behaviour
  of Spring's bean container. This avoids concurrency problems in multi-threaded
  environments like web applications.

Integration jasypt with Spring Security (Acegi Security)

  For details on how to integrate jasypt with Acegi, the standard security framework
  for Spring, please have a look at {{{springsecurity}this guide}}.
