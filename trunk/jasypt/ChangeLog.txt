1.2
=======

- Refactored the org.jasypt.util package: created util.digest, util.password,
  and util.text packages, and moved existing util classes to their corresponding
  packages. Also created PasswordEncryptor and TextEncryptor interfaces,
  to unify both standard- and strong-encryption implementations.
- Added org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor for a more
  configurable (yet easy) way of using a password encryptor.
- Added binary utils for easy encryption of binaries.
- Added number encryption functionalities (both for integer and decimal
  numbers). This means new StandardPBEIntegerEncryptor (for BigIntegers) and 
  StandardPBEDecimalEncryptor (for BigDecimals) in the org.jasypt.encryption.pbe
  package.


1.1
=======

- Added org.jasypt.util.StrongPasswordEncryptor as a util class for
  easy password encryption using a stronger algorithm.
- Added org.jasypt.util.MessageDigester as a util class for
  creating simple binary message digests.
- Added org.jasypt.digest.config.EnvironmentDigesterConfig and
  org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.EnvironmentPBEConfig for configuration
  of encryptors and digesters using environment variables and system properties.
- Objects of class org.jasypt.util.PasswordEncryptor now initialize their
  internal StandardStringDigester at instance creation.
- Made org.jasypt.digest.config.DigesterConfig and 
  org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.PBEConfig extend java.io.Serializable
