1.3
=======

- DigesterConfig and PBEConfig are not Serializable anymore.
- Added provider and providerName properties to DigesterConfig and
  SimpleDigesterConfig classes.
- Added providerClassName, providerName and saltGeneratorClassName
  configuration at EnvironmentDigesterConfig.
- StandardByteDigester, StandardStringDigester, Digester, 
  and ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor can now specify the JCE security provider
  (<tt>java.security.Provider</tt> implementation) which will be asked
  for the digest algorithm.
- Added provider and providerName properties to PBEConfig and
  SimplePBEConfig classes.
- Added providerClassName, providerName and saltGeneratorClassName
  configuration at EnvironmentPBEConfig.
- StandardPBEByteEncryptor, StandardPBEStringEncryptor, 
  StandardPBEBigIntegerEncryptor and StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor can now 
  specify the JCE security provider (<tt>java.security.Provider</tt> 
  implementation) which will be asked for the digest algorithm.
- Created new StringDigesterConfig configuration interface for digesters,
  which extends DigesterConfig and adds parameters "unicodeNormalizationIgnored"
  and "stringOutputType". Also created new implementations 
  SimpleStringDigesterConfig and EnvironmentStringDigesterConfig.
- Added Unicode Normalization step to StandardStringDigester, and also
  capabilities to return hexadecimal-encoded digest Strings instead of only
  BASE64 ones.


1.2
=======

- Merged jasypt-hibernate and jasypt-spring-security into main jasypt trunk.
- Package org.jasypt.util refactored. 
- Created PasswordEncryptor and TextEncryptor interfaces,
  to unify both basic- and strong-encryption implementations.
  NOTE: the old org.jasypt.util classes have been DEPRECATED, and will be
  removed in jasypt 1.3.
- Added org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor for a more
  configurable way of using the "easy" password encryptor.
- Added binary utils (org.jasypt.util.binary) for easy encryption of binaries.
- Added numeric encryption functionalities: new 
  StandardPBEBigIntegerEncryptor and StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor in the 
  org.jasypt.encryption.pbe package
- Added new org.jasypt.util.numeric package with easy utils for numeric 
  encryption.
- Refactored org.jasypt.hibernate classes into new "encryptor" and "type" 
  subpackages.
- Added HibernatePBEEncryptorRegistry support for BigInteger, BigDecimal and
  Byte encryptors
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of binaries (byte[]) into SQL BLOBs
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of BigIntegers into SQL NUMERICs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of BigDecimals into SQL NUMERICs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of Bytes into SQL VARCHARs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of Shorts into SQL VARCHARs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of Integers into SQL VARCHARs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of Longs into SQL VARCHARs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of Floats into SQL VARCHARs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of Doubles into SQL VARCHARs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of Booleans into SQL VARCHARs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of Dates into SQL VARCHARs.
- Added Hibernate type for encryption of Calendars into SQL VARCHARs.
- Added creation of standard encryptor in Hibernate encryptor objects
  so that setEncryptor() method becomes optional and hibernate encryptors
  can be directly configured via setPassword, setAlgorithm, etc.
- Refactored org.jasypt.springsecurity package: created new PasswordEncoder
  for use with both org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor
  or org.jasypt.digest.StringDigester implementations.
- Created new org.jasypt.springsecurity.PBEPasswordEncoder for using
  org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor or 
  org.jasypt.pbe.encryptor.PBEStringEncryptor from ACEGI Security.
- Created new salt generation infrastructure, making different implementations
  of salt generation possible (including fixed salt).
  

1.1
=======

- Added the ACEGI (Spring Security) integration add-on 
  (org.jasypt.springsecurity)
- Added org.jasypt.util.StrongPasswordEncryptor as a util class for
  easy password encryption using a stronger algorithm.
- Added org.jasypt.util.MessageDigester as a util class for
  creating simple binary message digests.
- Added org.jasypt.digest.config.EnvironmentDigesterConfig and
  org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.EnvironmentPBEConfig for configuration
  of encryptors and digesters using environment variables and system properties.
- Objects of class org.jasypt.util.PasswordEncryptor now initialize their
  internal StandardStringDigester at instance creation.
- Made org.jasypt.digest.config.DigesterConfig and 
  org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.PBEConfig extend java.io.Serializable

1.0

- First release of jasypt
