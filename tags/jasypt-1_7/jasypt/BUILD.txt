 Building JASYPT
 ---------------
 
 To build JASYPT you will need Maven 2. You can get it at:
 
     http://maven.apache.org

 Also, in order to pass the unit tests, you will need the
 Java Unlimited Jurisdiction Policy files installed for the JDK with
 which you are going to do the build.
     
 Build and install the project executing, from the JASYPT
 project root folder:
 
     mvn clean:clean install
     
 And you will get a fresh target/jasypt-{version}.jar file.
 You will also get it installed in your local repository at:
 
     $M2_REPO/org/jasypt/jasypt/{version}/jasypt-{version}.jar



 Generating Javadoc for JASYPT
 -----------------------------
 
 If you wish to generate the javadoc for JASYPT, execute this from the
 JASYPT root folder:
 
     mvn javadoc:javadoc
     
 This will generate the javadoc documentation in HTML format in:
 
     target/site/apidocs
