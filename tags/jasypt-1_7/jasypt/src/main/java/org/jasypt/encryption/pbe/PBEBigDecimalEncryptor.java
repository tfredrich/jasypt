/**
 * <p>
 * Common interface for all Password Based Encryptors which receive a 
 * BigDecimal message and return a BigDecimal result.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important</b>: The size of the result of encrypting a number, depending
 * on the algorithm, may be much bigger (in bytes) than the size of the 
 * encrypted number itself. For example, encrypting a 4-byte integer can
 * result in an encrypted 16-byte number. This can lead the user into 
 * problems if the encrypted values are to be stored and not enough room 
 * has been provided.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For a default implementation, see {@link StandardPBEBigDecimalEncryptor}.
