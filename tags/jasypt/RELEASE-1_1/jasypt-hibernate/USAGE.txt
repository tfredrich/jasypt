 
 Using JASYPT-HIBERNATE from Maven 2
 -----------------------------------
 
 To use it in your Maven 2 applications, you will need to add it as
 a dependency with:

     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.jasypt</groupId>
       <artifactId>jasypt-hibernate</artifactId>
       <version>{version}</version>
       <scope>compile</scope>
     </dependency>

 In order for this to work correctly, you need to have previously installed
 jasypt-hibernate in your local repository (as explained in BUILD.txt) or have a
 working internet connection to let maven automatically download 
 jasypt-hibernate binaries from Maven 2's central repositories.
 
 
 IMPORTANT: Adding jasypt-hibernate as a dependency to your maven 2 project will
 automatically add a dependency on jasypt, even if you do not specify so.
