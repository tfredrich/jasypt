/**
 * <p>
 * Implementation for {@link PBEConfig} which can be used from the
 * Web PBE Config infrastructure (Filter + Servlet) to set the
 * password for an encryptor from the web at initialization time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For an encryptor to be assigned a password from the web, it only has
 * to be assigned a WebPBEConfig object, which must be initialized with
 * <b>both</b> a unique name an a validation word. The name will identify
 * the config object (and thus the encryptor) and the validation word will
 * make sure that only an authorized person (for example, the application
 * deployer) sets the passwords.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As this class extends {@link SimplePBEConfig}, parameter values
 * can be also set with the usual <tt>setX</tt> methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For any of the configuration parameters, if its <tt>setX</tt>
 * method is not called, a <tt>null</tt> value will be returned by the
 * corresponding <tt>getX</tt> method.
