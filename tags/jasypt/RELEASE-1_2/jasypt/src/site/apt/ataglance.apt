Jasypt at a glance

  Jasypt is a java library which implements for you the current security standards, 
  and which you can use for securely:
  
      * <<Creating digests>>. Example of use: encrypting passwords.
      
      []
      
      * <<Encrypting texts, numbers or binaries using a password (Password 
      Based Encryption)>>. Example of use: encrypting personal user data.


  For doing this, you have two different <approaches>:
  
      * The <<easy>> interface: which makes most configuration decisions for you, 
      adequate if you have no knowledge of encryption and little interest
      in learning the concepts and internals.
      The <easy> interface is conformed of the classes in package 
      <<<org.jasypt.util>>>. {{{getting-started-easy.html}Learn more}}.
      
      []
      
      * The <<standard>> interface: which lets you take configuration decisions
      (algorithm, key obtention, etc.), and can be more suitable for environments
      in which more control and fine-tuning is needed.
      {{{getting-started-standard.html}Learn more}}.
