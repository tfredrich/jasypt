This directory contains the Jasypt CLI tools, designed to be executed from
the .bat (Windows) and .sh (Linux/Unix) files supplied for performing
encryption, decryption and digest operations at the command line.

**DO NOT** add the jasypt-cli-bundle.jar file into your classpath or that
of your projects, as it is a special file containing all jasypt dependencies 
and is not designed for that purpose (it is only meant to be executed from 
the CLI tools).

Use the files in the "dist" and "lib" folders instead.
