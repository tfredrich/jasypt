 
 Using JASYPT from Maven 2
 -------------------------
 
 
 In order to use it in your Maven 2 applications, you will need to add it as
 a dependency with:

     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.jasypt</groupId>
       <artifactId>jasypt</artifactId>
       <version>{version}</version>
       <scope>compile</scope>
     </dependency>
     
 Or, alternatively, you can use the "lite" artifact (see online docs) by
 specifying a classifier:
 
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.jasypt</groupId>
       <artifactId>jasypt</artifactId>
       <version>{version}</version>
       <classifier>lite</classifier>
       <scope>compile</scope>
     </dependency>

 In order for this to work correctly, you need to have previously installed
 jasypt in your local repository (as explained in BUILD.txt) or have a
 working internet connection to let maven automatically download jasypt 
 binaries from Maven 2's central repositories.
